            <p>Beth is a veteran teacher with 24 years experience teaching kindergarten and has a degree in Human Ecology from College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, Maine.  As a Nationally Board Certified Early Childhood Generalist, she works to educate the whole child.  Her students learn and grow through passion-driven service-learning projects.  Along with her students, she was honored by Next Generation Global Education for their work towards increasing food security.  She worked with her community to create outdoor learning spaces including a nature trail, community garden, and orchard at her small, rural, high-poverty school.  Her passion for science education ultimately earned a her Presidential Award for Excellence in Math and Science teaching.  This is one of the highest honors bestowed upon our nation's teachers.  She served on the practitioner advisory panel for <a href="https://www.nap.edu/catalog/19401/transforming-the-workforce-for-children-birth-through-age-8-a">a pivotal report</a> on early childhood by the Institute of Medicine and National Academy of Sciences.  Her love of meaningful integration of technology in the early childhood classroom earned her a National Semiconductor Innovative Educator Award in 1999.  Always modeling curiosity and lifelong learning, Beth continues to experiment and innovate.  She is currently a Skype Master Teacher and PBS Learning Media Innovative educator.  She was most recently honored by the state as County Teacher of the Year.  When Beth is not in the classroom she enjoys travel, yoga, music, glitter, and most of all hula hooping!</p>

            <h3 class="title">Curtis Bently</h3>
            <p>Curtis’ life long passion for science, especially paleontology, began as a child in Iowa.  After an early career as a drummer in a rock band, Curtis returned to school to earn degrees in biology (while working as a researcher in the South Carolina State Museum), geography, and law.  USA Today twice spotlighted him as an undergraduate student to watch. This combination of skills landed him a job in Washington, DC in a prestigious position as a trial attorney for the Department of Justice in the Environmental Enforcement Section.  Curtis went on to work for Maine State Legislature helping legislators make laws primarily dealing with critters but throughout his life, Curtis has pursued scientific and paleontological endeavours (including giving talks in elementary schools.)  Specimens he has collected can be found in numerous museum such as South Carolina State Museum, The Florida Museum of Natural History, and the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History.  Curtis has six scientific publications to his credit and discovered a new species of extinct sea turtle, Corsochelys bentleyi, that was named in his honor.  Curtis loves triathlons and is a two-time Ironman finisher and has competed in half-Ironman, Olympic and sprint distance triathlons. When he is not digging for fossils or preparing skeletons for study, he can be found running, biking, swimming, traveling around the world or banging on his drums!</p>
